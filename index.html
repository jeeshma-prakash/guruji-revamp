                    <h2>Journey to Inner Peace</h2>
                    <p>Know about Guruji
                        In his childhood during school days, the lunch bell would ring at 1:00 PM. Without a moment's
                        hesitation, Guruji would dash from school to his house. This journey was perilous, as the route
                        was—and still is—the busy Bangalore-Dharmapuri highway, which he had to cross to get home.
                        Despite the danger, he made the trip daily. Upon arriving, he would check if his mother(who was
                        ill) needed to use the restroom, serve her food, eat his own lunch, and then hurry back to
                        school. The tight schedule demanded his return within 45 minutes, when the next bell rang,
                        making his afternoon commute a challenging and emotional ordeal. In the evening, after school,
                        he would walk home leisurely, free from the earlier urgency, spend time conversing with his
                        mother, and then drift off to sleep. This routine marked the start of his second year in second
                        grade.</p>
